This repository is just for the practice of authentication and security. The practice was divided into six (6) levels where each preceeding level adds more security advantages over the former. 

1. The first level basically deals with storing user's username and password to a database.  In this case, a mongoose database was used to store user's data.

2. Level 2 involved encryption. In this level, the mongoose-encryption package was used to provide some encryption for the user's password generated. This level also provided some vulnerabilities hence the need for a more secure option.
